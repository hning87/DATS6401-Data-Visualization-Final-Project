# DATS6401-Data-Visualization-Final-Project
#Most Innovative Country Analysis

## Porject Description
Innovation means "a new idea, method, device, or the introduction of something new". The measurement of innovation proved to be inherently difficult, and what makes a country the benchmark for innovation? Many research studies suggest to rank the innovation strength of the countries by comparing patents, R&D etc. This project uses visualization to analyse the key indicators of innovation including patent applications, the value of manufacturing, number of research paper publications and R&D expenditure. 

## Key Findings
Most innovative countries based on the data visualization and analysis:   
Tier S: Germany, Japan, Korea Republic, United States   
Tier A: China (still rising)   
Tier B: Canada, France, India, Italy, United Kingdom   
Tier C: Brazil, Russian Federation
