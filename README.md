## Porject Description
Innovation means "a new idea, method, device, or the introduction of something new". The measurement of innovation proved to be inherently difficult, and what makes a country the benchmark for innovation? Many research studies suggest to rank the innovation strength of the countries by comparing patents, R&D etc.    
This project uses visualization to analyse the key indicators of innovation including:
* Patent applications    
* The value of manufacturing   
* Number of research paper publications   
* R&D expenditure   
* R&D expenditure share of GDP%

Tier S: Germany, Japan, Korea Republic, United States   
Tier A: China (still rising)   
Tier B: Canada, France, India, Italy, United Kingdom
